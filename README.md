# Implementations-
(1) Data sets of STNs and Multiagent STNs are available at https://data.4tu.nl/repository/uuid:776a266e-81c6-41ee-9d23-8c89d90b6992
(2) Parser.py is used for translating data sets to inputs for algorithms.
(3) ACS and P3C algorithms are implemented in AC_PPC.py; DisACS and DPPC algorithms are implemented in DisACS.py and DPPC.py respectively.
